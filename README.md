# Wide input voltage range step down converter 
This is mostly just a PCB based on out-of-the-box application note. See [TI site](http://ti.com) for more information.
The best thing about this part is that you can convert for large (unisolated) voltage difference without transformer.

PCB also works for LM5018 (300mA) and LM5019 (100mA)

The project in made in DesignSpark PCB.
